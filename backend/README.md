To create the virtual environment and not overwrite your global python versions locally,

  "use python -m venv [venv name]"

Use this in the backend to activate the virtual environment where you can run uvicorn and pip install everything, command may block, then you have to enable running scripts in cmd or whatever terminal

  ".\venv\Scripts\Activate"
